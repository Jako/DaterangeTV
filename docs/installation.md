## Build it from source

To build and install the package from source you could use [Git Package
Management](https://github.com/TheBoxer/Git-Package-Management). The GitHub

to build that package locally. Use this option, if you want to debug DaterangeTV
and/or contribute bugfixes and enhancements.
