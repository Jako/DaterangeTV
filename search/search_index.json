In the MODX Manager, navigate to the Package Manager page, and select 'Search locally for packages' from the dropdown button. DaterangeTV should now show up in the list of available packages. Click the corresponding 'Install' button and follow the instructions to complete the installation. Build it from source To build and install the package from source you could use Git Package Management . The GitHub repository of DaterangeTV contains a config.json to build that package locally.
